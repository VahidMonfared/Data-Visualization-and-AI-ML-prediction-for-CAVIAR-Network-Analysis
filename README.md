Networks – CAVIAR Case Study
Context

This case study explores the CAVIAR project—a joint investigative effort conducted between 1994 and 1996 by the Montreal Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Over two years, 11 wiretap warrants were obtained, each valid for approximately two months, forming the basis of 11 investigative phases. What makes this case particularly unique is its strategic focus: rather than arresting suspects immediately, the primary objective was to repeatedly seize illicit drug shipments while allowing the network to remain operational, thereby uncovering more about its structure and participants. Arrests were made only at the conclusion of the investigation.

Throughout the operation, police successfully intercepted 11 shipments from the trafficking network, resulting in estimated financial losses of $32 million for those involved. Some phases had multiple seizures, while others had none. Below is a summary of the key phases involving drug seizures and their associated monetary values:

    Phase 4: 1 seizure, $2.5 million, 300 kg marijuana

    Phase 6: 3 seizures, $1.3 million, two 15 kg marijuana + one 2 kg cocaine

    Phase 7: 1 seizure, $3.5 million, 401 kg marijuana

    Phase 8: 1 seizure, $360,000, 9 kg cocaine

    Phase 9: 2 seizures, $4.3 million, 2 kg cocaine + 500 kg marijuana

    Phase 10: 1 seizure, $18.7 million, 2200 kg marijuana

    Phase 11: 2 seizures, $1.3 million, 23 kg cocaine (12 + 11 kg)

This ongoing disruption gives us a rare opportunity to study how a criminal network evolves under sustained pressure from law enforcement. It allows for an in-depth analysis of how the network structure adapts over time in response to increasing constraints.
About the Network

The network is composed of 110 individuals, where nodes 1 to 82 are identified as traffickers and nodes 83 to 110 are non-traffickers (such as investors, accountants, and business owners). The primary target of the investigation was Daniel Serero, believed to be the head of a drug trafficking ring operating in downtown Montreal. Initially, the group focused on importing marijuana from Morocco via Spain. However, after the first major seizure in phase 4, the organization shifted to importing cocaine from Colombia through the United States.

Key members of the network include:

    Daniel Serero (n1): Leader of the organization

    Pierre Perlini (n3): Serero’s main lieutenant

    Alain (n83) & Gérard (n86) Levy: Financial backers and money transporters

    Wallace Lee (n85): Accountant handling financial operations

    Gaspard Lino (n6): Spanish broker

    Samir Rabbat (n11): Marijuana supplier from Morocco

    Lee Gilbert (n88): Wallace Lee’s associate (later turned informant)

    Beverly Ashton (n106): Lino’s partner, responsible for transporting money and documents

    Antonio Iannacci (n89), Mohammed Echouafni (n84), Patrick Lee (n87): Investors

    Richard Gleeson (n5), Bruno de Quinzio (n8), Gabrielle Casale (n76): Handled marijuana retrieval

    Roderik Janouska (n77): Had airport connections

    Salvatore Panetta (n82), Steve Cunha (n96): Logistics and transportation managers (Cunha later turned informant)

    Ernesto Morales (n12): Main organizer of cocaine imports and link to Colombian sources

    Oscar Nieri (n17): Morales’ assistant

    Richard Brebner (n80): Handled cocaine transport from the U.S. to Montreal

    Ricardo Negrinotti (n33): U.S. cocaine contact handing off to Brebner

    Johnny Pacheco (n16): Cocaine supplier

Objective

    Understand and visualize the network structure across the 11 investigative phases.

    Apply various centrality measures to identify key players in the network.

    Track and compare how the importance of different nodes changes over time using centrality analysis.
